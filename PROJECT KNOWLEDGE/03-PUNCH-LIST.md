## Now (active focus) — Unit 2 (shop economy v2, punch #3) is next up

## Next
- [ ] #3 — Unit 2: shop economy v2 (rulings R1/R3): per-good dynamic buy
  pricing, player price-bias lever (swept clamp, expect narrower than
  50–150%), ambient imports/restock-to-baseline (C5), tier-up stock unlocks,
  shop roster expansion — **Horvik, Lowe, Zaff, Aubury, Swordshop greenlit**
  (Apothecary/Thessalia deferred; stagger openings optional),
  **purchase→treasury routing at 40%** (tune 30–50% band; one ledger unit
  with city-buy outflow — sweep once, re-center once; add treasury
  inflow/outflow telemetry lines). NOTE: design the KI-4 fix (combat reward
  saturation / price coupling) into this unit while pricing files are open.
- [ ] #4 — Unit 3: C1 parameterized nudge popups (+ B4 disabled-with-tooltip
  gating). UI tech RULED (R11): Control nodes for new popups only, shared
  visual constants, render-layer only, decisions-log entry on the paradigm
  split. `loot_policy` = drop-filter semantics (R7). Fight popup after #1;
  Skill popup can float earlier.

## Later / icebox
- [ ] #5 — Unit 4: Bank + GE order book + City BUY orders + City Inventory
  (the big gold-ledger unit — sweep g* before/after; offline statistical
  fill model). RULED: bank ships WITH the order book (R9 — refunds need a
  deposit target); **city buy orders escrow treasury gold at posting**,
  cancel/expiry refunds remainder (R1); GE tax 1% at open, treasury-routed,
  tunable 1–3%; city orders untaxed; tax on hero-side proceeds uniformly
  (R8); shop 3% tax untouched. After this unit, gather incentives migrate
  to funded mechanisms (buy orders + price-bias) and pure-utility incentives
  retire (R5 end state).
- [ ] #6 — Unit 5: C4 shop sell-back (ceiling `min(saturation, 0.30 × GE
  reference)`, graceful degradation when GE illiquid — adopted as written,
  R2) + C3 item-cost upgrade ladders + C5 shop crafting queues
  (reservation-on-start FIFO). Never ship C4 alone; keep bug-class lens on
  the C2→C3/C5 closed loop.
- [ ] #7 — Content wave (e): death/graves/PK → canon social negatives
  (retire interim competition-friction).
- [ ] #8 — Content wave (f): buildings expansion / reincarnation.
- [ ] #9 — Content wave (g): Zezima endgame.
- [ ] #10 — B3 topbar deltas (Save/Load/Log buttons, subtitle) — render-only,
  anytime.
- [x] #11 — MERGED into #1a (R10 pulled the save-migration scaffold forward
  to Unit 0). (2026-06-11)
- [ ] #12 — Deferred planner calls: INCENTIVE_STEP finer notches · Stage-2
  combat polish (premise undercut, optional) · dead `_route*` heuristic
  cleanup in SimWorld · Apothecary + Thessalia shops (R3 deferred) ·
  relocate Vannaka to Edgeville when zones expand westward (R4).

## Done
- [x] #1 — **Unit 0: Slayer slice COMPLETE** (2026-06-11 → 2026-06-12; zones
  slice 2, absorbs B2; rulings R4/R5/R6/R10). #1a save-migration scaffold
  (upgrader chain, ruled gate green) · #1b Slayer core (Vannaka,
  knowledge-gated feasible tasks, on-task pull, save v2) · #1c funded
  per-kill bounty (one affordability rule, FIGHT utility incentive retired)
  · #1d aggressive monsters + Scurrius gate + canon survival triad (deaths
  2,096→4/24k ticks, rep 0→61) · #1e closing sweep (SLAYER_ON_TASK locked
  +20; §18 split — rival-lean held/KI-5 resolved, combat-share failed/KI-4
  re-confirmed; BRAIN_V2 4th test: worsens monoculture 52±3 vs 44±5,
  default stays OFF; band re-baselined 1,460±332). Full sub-item detail in
  07-CHANGELOG (2026-06-11/12 entries).
- [x] #2 — **Unit 1: catalog migration COMPLETE** (2026-06-12): canon catalog
  ids are the sim's single item truth — inv/equip/shop keys renamed (ore→
  iron_ore, cooked_fish→trout, display-name gear/tools/ammo→ids), shop base
  values catalog-sourced (KI-8 RESOLVED: iron_ore 17), `GEAR_DROPS`/
  `GEAR_TIER` retired into items.json (dropPool/tier/style), recipes-as-data
  (cook raw_trout→trout + smith 3×iron_ore→iron_sword via
  `ContentDB.craft_output`), tradeable flags gate vendoring, SHOPS TRADE
  GEAR (General-Store board, fill-0.5 open ≈ old half-value anchor, flat
  vendoring retired), `GE_TAX`→`SHOP_TAX` (R8). Save v3 + v2→v3 upgrader
  (id remap + gear-board injection). Suite 153/153 (+12 Unit-1 checks);
  3 gates PASS; render parses; telemetry drift +4%, day-23 g/cap ~1,790
  (within 1σ of the 1,460±332 band).
- [x] #0 — MVP slice complete: build steps 0–6 ("A Living Varrock") all
  CLOSED & green (99/99 → now 101/101) — economy attractor validated;
  population/social/control-tiers/save-load/offline/LOD gated. (2026-06-09)
- [x] #0.1 — M1 visual/UX port (canon 46×34→50×38 Varrock map, camera,
  topbar/roster/popup UI); M2 BRAIN_V2 measured (default-off, 4th test
  queued); M3a gear/equipment/smithing slices; M3b styles/ranged/magic/
  triangle plumbing/ammo; pathfinding (grid BFS, walls solid); §6 re-centers
  (RAT_DROP halved; UPKEEP_RATE 0.80); goal system; tool requirements;
  zones slice 1 (6 camps). All gated 101/101. (2026-06-09 → 2026-06-10)
- [x] #0.2 — Read-only economy/incentives probe + ANALYSIS REPORT (Parts
  A–E of the design-partner prompt) + PROJECT KNOWLEDGE seeding. (2026-06-11)
